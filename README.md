# Event Orgs.
- A multiuser event management single-page application where users can view events and create, update, and delete events.
- The main purpose of this project was to practice building a Single Page Application using React and react-router, and the backend part using node.js, Express. Created a Dummy backend where information is stored in a JSON file.

- Note: The backend is hosted on render.com which makes the server inactive after 15 minutes of inactivity. So for the
  first time, you are logging in, it may take up to 30s to log in as the render.com take 30s to reactivate the server.
  Once reactivated, there won't be any delay anymore.
